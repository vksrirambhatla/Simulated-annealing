The script:
Loads a molecular structure from an XYZ file.
Loads experimental XRD data (2θ angles and intensities).
Defines a function to compute the theoretical XRD pattern for a given structure.
Uses simulated annealing to optimize the molecule’s position and orientation to match the experimental pattern.
Saves the refined structure as a CIF file.
Plots the experimental and best-fit theoretical patterns for comparison.
